# scd30Code
This is adapted code based on code from Adafruit that's a little easier to paste into a spreadsheet. It is used for my carbon capture project. Click here to learn more about that: https://nicholsonlabs.gitbook.io/labs/carbon-capture.

To use this in a spreadsheet, make sure you have the "Timestamp" button clicked. Then, copy and paste everything into a spreadsheet. Once in a spreadsheet, select the column of where you pasted the data, and go to Data > Split text to columns. This is pictured below:

Note: in this picture, the data had already been split into columns, but you get the point.

After you're done with that, label your columns to make a graph. I chose the titles Temp, Time, CO2 ppm, and Humidity. Then, select all your columns, and press the chart button to create a graph, like pictured below. Feel free to change your graph style, but in my opinion, the default one is the best.

Note: I had already made the graph, but you get the idea.

Now you can visualize your data from your CO2 sensor!
Thanks again to Adafruit for the majority of the work.
